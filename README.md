Test programs for Forth 2012 and ANS Forth

Checking that a Forth 2012/ANS Forth system is compliant with the Forth 2012
and ANS Forth standards requires a set of test programs. This repository
provides some test programs that go some way towards meeting this need. The
tests are based on the widely known ANS Forth tester developed by John Hayes
and include his original core tests. The tests cover most of the word sets of
the original ANS Forth (Forth 94) standard and the Forth 2012 standard that
extends and supersedes ANS Forth.

The word sets tested are:
- Core words (by John Hayes) plus some additional tests
- Core extension words
- The Double Number word set and extensions
- The Exception word set and extensions
- The Facility word set extensions (structures only)
- The File-Access word set and extensions
- The Locals word set
- The Memory-Allocation word set
- The Programming-Tools word set and extensions (incomplete - a
  few words in each)
- The Search-Order word set and extensions
- The String word set
